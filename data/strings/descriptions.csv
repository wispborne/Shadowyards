ms_charybdis,SHIP,"Swift and possessed of a large weapons battery for her class, the Charybdis-class Strike Carrier is capable of fielding large numbers of fighter craft while fighting back with surprising ferocity.

Her combat capability and fighter capacity allow the Charybdis to operate relatively independently of other combat ships; the class is generally regarded as being close to self reliant, though her fuel capacity and cargo stores are insufficient for prolonged action without logistics support.  The Charybdis suffered from severely conflicting development goals, however, and her design is marred by a number of potentially fatal compromises.

Her carrier capabilities and strong offensive abilities have come at the cost of having a worryingly thin armor belt, and her hull is markedly fragile for her mass.  Her point defense coverage is merely adequate for her class, though this can be made up for with her fighters providing cover.  While the vessels flux capacity is good, and her shield systems are reasonably strong, her capacitors are bulky and have trouble adjusting to combat loads in an efficient manner.  Adding to all this is the ships great cost, in large part due to the twin 'Novalith' reactors needed to efficiently power the ship and her engines.

The SRA is somewhat cautious about sharing hulls of this class with privateers and independent operators, and as such the Charybdis is only rarely seen outside of Shadowyards battlegroups, and is most commonly used otherwise by unusually successful Mercenary captains.",,,
ms_morningstar,SHIP,"The Morningstar is considered the backbone of SRA patrol formations, as it is inexpensive to maintain while still offering a reasonable punch; a solid array of energy mounts, two small missile hardpoints and a small fighter bay allow it face a wide variety of battlefield threats.

The ship is named for her highly distinctive sensor system, the crown of spines circling her prow.  These sensors provide highly accurate combat telemetry and detection, though they are not noteworthy outside of combat scenarios.  Some efforts have been made to upgrade these sensors to allow for more generalist mission parameters, but the Morningstars internal hull volume has proved insufficient.

While lacking redundancy, the ships unusual extended drive system provides good speed, and is remarkably fuel efficient.  An array of potent thrusters, combined with the ships length, offer excellent agility for her size.  Her shields, while not a straight up match for the Medusa, are paired with one of the best flux dissipation systems in the sector, giving her good battlefield longevity.  Unfortunately, however, like most SRA. vessels her advantages come at the cost of a middling armor belt and fragile hull.",,,
ms_enlil,SHIP,"The Enlil is a versatile multi-role frigate, noted as being particularly reliable with good loiter time. With a pair of synergy hardpoints these vessels are able to fit nearly any mission role, while two small energy hardpoints provide rearward defense.

Comparatively more sturdily built than most SRA offerings, the vessel is of only modest speed for her size.  Despite this she is quite maneuverable and capable bringing her formidable forward armament to bear on most targets fairly easily.  While her frontal weaponry lends itself to an attack role, this frigate is often fitted in a bewildering variety of fashions to serve as a ‘Jack-of-All-Trades’ frigate; while rarely as good as whatever vessel she is emulating her flexability allows her to fill holes in the battle line quite neatly.",,,
ms_seski,SHIP,"Designed with speed in mind, the Seski class corvette is among the fastest ships in the sector.  Intended for use as a fast courier or blockade runner, vessels of this class are also put to use as a fast picket.

The Seski relies almost entirely upon her speed and maneuverability to survive battle; her armor is practically nonexistant and her shield array lacks the bredth to defend her from concentrated assault, and her small size has limited the amount of capacitors she can carry.  While decently armed for her diminuitive size she is not expected to be able to take on a combat frigate in a slugging match.",,,
ms_shamash,SHIP,"Sleek and deadly, the Shamash has, in large part due to her efficient and highly aggressive weapons layout, built up a formidable reputation as a hunter/killer frigate.

Her phase cloak system, while significantly less efficient than those of the Domain, is far less costly to activate, and represents a significant improvement over her earlier sister, the Enthalpy experimental phase destroyer. In order to aid her in her role as a hunter, the Shamash is fitted with a coaxial REIS system, which in skillful hands can leave even far larger ships at the mercy of this deadly craft.

For those willing to entertain a somewhat more aggressive hunting style, this ship brings a formidable advantage, always playing on the knifes edge, phasing in and out to avoid and deliver critical harm.",,,
ms_inanna,SHIP,"Sometimes referred to as the 'Left Hook,' the Inanna is the oldest vessel of Shadowyards manufacture still in common use by the SRA.

Despite what many agree is a somewhat flawed concept, the vessel has been the recipient of an aggressive upgrade program, leaving it far in advance of other Shadowyards designs of comparable age. As a result the Inanna is, on paper at least, one of the more deadly small craft in the sector.

Though her highly unusual design means she is quite difficult to use, her heavy firepower and output increasing mechanisms have nevertheless granted her a rather exaggerated reputation as a 'giant killer.'",,,
ms_sargasso,SHIP,"The Sargasso is one of the more effective small carriers in the Sector, providing a combination of speed and hangar space in an economical package.

The Sargassos most notable feature is her 'moon pool,' the open area encased by the ships hull which acts as the vessels hangar area.

While highly innovative, the design itself was plagued by problems early in the vessels career, as the far less predictable nature and more complicated docking arrangements confounded normal deck procedures; after several fatal accidents, Shadowyards engineers resorted to a line of dedicated beta level personality constructs specially made to handle the pool.  While this solved the crashes, an unexpected emergent behavior arose; instances where the constructs started relaying combat information to pilots assigned to the ship.

While unintended, the resultant boost of combat efficiency in fighter craft has seen the class refitted with systems specifically to boost the quality of this interference.  A side effect is that, among flight crews, vessels of this class are known not by their official designation, but rather by their cantankerous AI flight controllers.",,,
ms_elysium,SHIP,"A swift and efficient light cruiser, the Elysium was designed to house the Pandora array, at the time a modular, high powered sensor system, which has over time mutated into its main armament.

The Pandora is a powerful, if slow firing weapon, augmented by the potent starboard broadside Elysium possesses. However, despite this extraordinary weapons system, the vessel's defenses are lightweight and she has considerable difficulty standing against heavier cruisers. Nevertheless, she is an excellent commerce raider and fast attack ship, a role augmented by her Remote Engine Inhibitor System, and is often used as the command ship for Shadowyards destroyer groups.",,,
ms_elysium_P,SHIP,"This ship has been heavily modified by its pirate crew, stripping out much of the difficult to maintain sensor equipment and energy damanding main weapon, and replacing it with heavy ballistic firepower.

A swift and efficient light cruiser, the Elysium was designed to house the Pandora array, at the time a modular, high powered sensor system, which has over time mutated into its main armament.

The Pandora is a powerful, if slow firing weapon, augmented by the potent starboard broadside Elysium possesses.

Nevertheless, she is an excellent commerce raider and fast attack ship, a role augmented by her Remote Engine Inhibitor System, and is often used as the command ship for Shadowyards destroyer groups.",,,
ms_tartarus,SHIP,"The Tartarus is Shadowyards Heavy Industries preferred ship of the line, intended to be the Anvil to the hammer of other, faster moving Shadowyards vessels.

One of their older designs, the Tartarus is far from the most heavily armed cruiser available, but is noted for being quite sturdy, particularly by the SRA's standards.  Her hull is thick and amply armored and her shielding systems are both resilient and efficient.  Beyond this, her flux capacity gives her a significant reserve of defensive and offensive power.

Equipped with a trio bow mounted Synergy hardpoints, the vessel is a flexible combatant and with her Siege defense systems can present a thorny proposition at considerable range.",,,
ms_scylla,SHIP,"In many ways the culmination of Shadowyards design philosophy in regards to Phase ships, the Scylla-class Phase Cruiser possesses an almost disproportionately heavy armament for her size.

Much like her smaller cousins, the Scylla is able to enter phase relatively inexpensively but the distributed nature of Shadowyards phase anchoring systems introduces much higher inefficiency in maintaining dives as opposed to standard Domain equipment. As such the best captains and crews at using these vessels tend to wait until the last possible moment to engage the cloaking systems.

Her heavy weapons banks, combined with two 'Hydra' phase drones have given her a reputation as an especially fearsome opponent, and vessels of this class are hated and lusted after by privateers across the sector. Shadowyards considers the vessel to be an extremely valuable asset, however, and as such they are only rarely seen outside of their control.",,,
ms_mimir,SHIP,"Until the SRA augmented it’s battle line with the Vardr-class battleship, the Mimir was the largest direct combatant manufactured by the SRA. The Mimir is a formidable and versatile battlecruiser, which like most current SRA vessels is capable of extended operations with minimal support.

For her size the vessel is unusually swift and has had particular effort put in to ensuring that her maneuvering ability is a cut above other Battlecruisers or Battleships; in particular this is suspected to be due to the super-heavy phase energy cannon occupying much of the Mimir's bow. This 'Nídhöggr Lance' is capable punching through the heaviest armor, though it is less effective against shield systems.

Her unusual appearance, even by Shadowyards standards, combined with her unprecedented main cannon, has caused some to speculate that the vessel is in fact based off of an alien derelict rather than being of human origin, much to the consternation of SRA scientists and engineers.",,,
ms_lambent,SHIP,"A mid sized fueling ship built by the SRA, the Lambent is mostly notable for being almost entirely automated, only occasionally requiring crew to provide periodic maintenance, though a small crew is maintained aboard to monitor the onboard systems.

Offering a slightly less capacious fuel bunker than it's more common cousin the Phaeton, it is the Lambents extraordinarily light maintenace requirements that most commonly see it selected. Additional berthing is maintained aboard the vessel in case more extensive repairs than the automated systems can provide are needed, but this has most famously been used to transform a Lambent into an impromptu, and highly explosive, lifeboat.",,,
ms_solidarity,SHIP,"The Solidarity class Armed Frieghter is a capable transport ship, designed to be able to deliver cargo to any port of call through all but the most adverse conditions.

A bit less capable in prolonged engagement than her ideological cousin the Mule, due to her more fragile hull and fewer turreted weapons emplacements, the Solidarity is nonetheless fairly formidable for a freight hauler and is typically ignored in favor of easier prey by pirates and other malcontents.

The vessel has an enlarged shuttle landing platform on her starboard flank, and there has been some speculation that the Solidarity could be converted into a light carrier relatively easily, but the ubiquity of the Tarsus and its sister the Condor, to say nothing of the Sargasso, has resulted in such speculation rarely seeing any serious pursuit.",,,
ms_skinwalker,SHIP,"The Skinwalker is a highly mobile, advanced fighter design intended to provide top cover against enemy fighter craft; utilizing a small particle cannon and its blackcap missile system, it presents a serious threat to enemy fighter wings.

While not exceptionally heavily armed, it possesses a unique high-density flux capacitor, which, combined with it's speed, agility and broad shielding make it difficult to overwhelm; should these fail, the Skinwalker is still quite tough, giving the flight crew time to elude their attackers and return to base.",,,
ms_potnia,SHIP,"Cheap to maintain and inexpensive to build, the Potnia is a personnel transport that is somewhat common in the areas around Shadowyards controlled space.

The Potnia is not quite as capable a transport ship as the more common Valkyrie, only able to carry a single above strength company of Marines; the ship is considered to have a slightly better command and control ability for soldiers operating from her, however, due to the large, high gain communications array taking up much of the upper levels of the ships starboard side.",,,
msp_potniaBis,SHIP,"A favorite of pirates and mercenaries due to low operating costs and her aggressive weapons layout, the Potnia-bis is regularly encountered even outside Shadowyards space.

Much of the internal space of these vessels has been given over to additional generators, magazines and the engines supporting the additional weapons mounts.  The original shielding systems are typically too much of a strain on the ship, even with the upgraded generator systems, and so are nearly always replaced with a MK I Shield Emitter, which are abundantly common across the sector due to Buffalo Mk.II conversions.

The resulting ship is capable of producing blistering firepower, though its punch is to an extent countered by its own improvised power supply systems, which tend to overload in the heat of battle.  Despite this, the vessel is popular with her crews and captains, who praise the ships ability to deliver a killer blow to their enemies.",,,
msp_thresher,SHIP,"Built largely from the salvaged remains of destroyed Elysium-class Light Cruisers, the Thresher is a deadly and aggressively upgunned Light Cruiser with extraordinary offensive firepower.

While not in any way an inexpensive or common vessel, the Thresher is well loved by those rogues lucky enough to acquire one, as it is a tremendously effective raiding ship.  It's battery, while less focused, is capable of matching the offensive capabilities of larger and heavier cruisers over short bursts, while still possessing the speed and maneuverability to run down most merchant shipping.

Much like the ubiquitous Buffalo Mk II, these vessels come in a bewildering number of configurations, no two being exactly alike.",,,
msp_southpaw,SHIP,"Rugged and dependable, the Southpaw is a fierce little frigate capable of dishing out very strong firepower.

These ships are often constructed from the remains of Shadowyards vessels otherwise too badly damaged to recover, taking what little remains of various craft and turning them into shockingly serviceable combat ships, possible largely due to the highly modular nature of SRA engineering. While her acceleration is poor, her top speed is quite good and these vessels are more than capable of running down fleeing merchant shipping.

Despite these advantages, the Southpaw has a reputation for being a finicky combat vessel, as her weapons systems exceed her cobbled together power systems ability to deal with them; in the hands of a skillful captain, however, the damage a Southpaw can deliver is not to be underestimated.",,,
ms_neriad,SHIP,"Designed to be launched from planetary bases, the Neriad is a rare aerospace fighter design amongst the more commonly space based fighter craft encountered in the sector.

The Neriad is equipped with a small, rapid fire auto cannon which is mostly useful against fighters and missiles; this primary armament is backed up with a load of Blackcap missiles, which can give it the edge in fighter engagements and theoretically allows it to threaten larger craft.  Low cost and ease of maintenance were key design goals for the craft, as they were intended to maintain a cheap garrison force for planetary governors.  As such, the SRA has spread these fighters to near ubiquity across under defended worlds throughout the sector, and its low price point and ease of acquisition has made it reasonably popular among independent spacers as well.",,,
ms_raksasha,SHIP,"The primary bomber craft in use by Shadowyards renegades and associated privateers, the Raksasha is a capable attack craft centered around the D-14 'Tusk' torpedo.

The Raksashas primary defense against hostile fast movers and anti-fighter missiles is a small in built 'mini-flak' package, which fires a spread of four explosive shells, as well as a decent shield system.  Though not nearly so well protected as the Trident, the Raksasha is nevertheless a formidable bomber craft.",,,
ms_kobold,SHIP,"Designed around a 'Splinter' rocket pod modified for extreme range, the Kobold is an effective fire support craft and is particularly able at overwhelming gravitic shielding.

Close in defense is provided by a stripped down burst laser system and a 'Dreamcatcher' flare system.",,,
ms_ashnan,SHIP,"A small cargo hauler in fairly common use in the systems surrounding Anar.  Ships of this type keep out of combat as much as possible, as their solitary weapons battery is insufficient to really defend the craft.

The seriousness of this shortcoming has prevented the Ashnan from being more commonly adopted; unfortunately limitations of the ships reactor and drive train have made retrofitting the vessel to be better able to defend itself a daunting task, only partially resolved by programming it’s utility drones with primitive combat routines.",,,
ms_morningstar_L,SHIP,"This vessel has been transferred to the Persean League as part of a lend-lease equipment program, and has been put through a comprehensive refit to match it to League standards.  Most offensive energy weapons slots have been replaced with ballistic mounts, and additional armor plating has been fitted at some cost to flux capacity.  Additionally, the Morningstars sensor boosting equipment has been removed in favor of a set of Plasma Jets.

The Morningstar is considered the backbone of SRA patrol formations, as it is inexpensive to maintain while still offering a reasonable punch; a solid array of energy mounts, two small missile hardpoints and a small fighter bay allow it face a wide variety of battlefield threats.

The ship is named for her highly distinctive sensor system, the crown of spines circling her prow.  These sensors provide highly accurate combat telemetry and detection, though they are not noteworthy outside of combat scenarios.  Some efforts have been made to upgrade these sensors to allow for more generalist mission parameters, but the Morningstars internal hull volume has proved insufficient.

While lacking redundancy, the ships unusual extended drive system provides good speed, and is remarkably fuel efficient.  An array of potent thrusters, combined with the ships length, offer excellent agility for her size.  Her shields, while not a straight up match for the Medusa, are paired with one of the best flux dissipation systems in the sector, giving her good battlefield longevity.  Unfortunately, however, like most SRA. vessels her advantages come at the cost of a middling armor belt and fragile hull.",,,
ms_clade,SHIP,"A potent heavy destroyer, the Clade is a craft that seems to have been designed around the concept of being a deadly annoyance.

The hull of the first Clade was laid down shortly before the collapse of the Gate System, but due to the chaos following the collapse the project was first significantly delayed, and then suspended.  The class remained in limbo until SC 33, when increasingly internecine warfare between the various factions in the sector required that the SRA field a heavy combat destroyer in order to supplement the Morningstar-class.

Since first undergoing space-trial, the Clade has garnered a reputation as a truly vexatious distraction, in large part because it is too deadly too ignore, but also very difficult to decisively destroy.  Clade captains favor aggressively engaging target ships and then utilizing their powerful retro-burners to suddenly retreat, evading counter attack, only to return to the fray once they enemy has found themselves thoroughly distracted.",,,
ms_belet-seri,SHIP,"Equipped with an extensive sensor suite, the Belet-Seri is somewhat rarely deployed to enhance the detection ranges of SRA patrol fleets; in combat the class mostly sees use as an escort, as it distinctly lacking in firepower.

Introduced, albeit in rough form, during the Domains crackdown against the Shadowyards rebellion, it is thought that the proto-Belets advanced detection abilities allowed the Yardies to realize their position had been compromised and is likely to have been critical in allowing them to evade Domain sweeps in the aftermath of the destruction of their Merid fastness.",,,
msp_boss_potniaBis,SHIP,"Across the sector, there exist many unique ship classifications resulting from extensive modifications to a base design. While most differ only in minor characteristics, some Mod-Hulls (as they are called) go above and beyond anything the original is capable of. These ships often gain legendary reputations for their accomplishments in the battlefield, and become the prized possessions of elite privateers, bounty hunters, and tech miners.

The Potnia-Bis design is already a heavy modification of the Potnia transport, but the Maleficent takes things even further. In a feat of engineering, this Mod-Hull streamlines the haphazard design of the Potnia-Bis, bringing the ship into full military specifications and improving performance across the board. Many captains have died picking a fight with the Maleficent, thinking to be a much softer target than it truly is.","The Potnia-Bis design is already a heavy modification of the Potnia transport, but the Maleficent takes things even further.

The one-of-a-kind Poseidon replaces the drone bay and rear assembly of the Charybdis-class hull with a secondary flux core. This extra core powers an additional set of thrusters and grants the ship the ability to use the Tartarus' signature siege mode, significantly improving its combat capabilities while maintaining its carrier status. On top of this, the Posiedon uses an altered superstructure and turret layout, increasing the ship's overall firepower and toughness.","The one-of-a-kind Poseidon replaces the drone bay and rear assembly of the Charybdis-class hull with a secondary flux core.

ms_hydra_drone,SHIP,"The Hydra is a sophisticated combat drone, designed specifically with the Scylla-class in mind.  Equipped with a compact SRA ‘Anchor'-style phase cloak system and a small afterburner, the Hydra is swift and long-lasting. Each drone is armed with a small infernium flechette cannon and a Lancet anti-missile pod.

Two of these formidable battle drones can be deployed by the Scylla at a time, and their sophisticated beta-level personality constructs allow them to wander a considerable distance from their mother ship.",Drones (high tech),"Deploys two drones equipped with phase cloak systems, afterburners, an infernium flechette cannon, and a Lancet anti-missile pod.",
ms_skadi,SHIP,"The Skadi is a competent fleet carrier, whose armaments package is capable of defending it in close combat.  While lacking the sheer capacity of the Astral, or the close combat ability of the Legion, the vessel is nonetheless considered a capable middle ground between the two.

There is some suggestion that designs for a ship similar to the Skadi significantly predate the Collapse and may even have been collaborated upon by multiple separate rebel groups at various times; the fighter was often the weapon of choice for revolutionary movements, who were often hampered by a lack of suitable craft from which to deploy them, and a ship such as the Skadi was no doubt the dream of many such organizations.",,,
ms_minos,SHIP,"A sturdy workhorse cruiser, the Minos is a popular craft due to it's durability, ease of maintenance and considerable fuel bunker; these ships are kitted for deep space exploration and are expected to operate for extended periods with little external support.  As a lone Minos is often relatively easy prey however, this rarely occurs given the danger present throughout the Sector.

Much of the Minos' internal volume is taken up by her sizable cargo holds, fuel bays and drone servicing areas, leaving only a small capacity for additional crew, and the ship itself is noted as being particularly cramped, though her accommodations are slightly improved from average in a partial effort to counteract the confined space aboard.",,,
msp_baseplate,SHIP,"Speculated to exist primarily as a means to dispose of particularly troublesome subordinates, the Baseplate-class Carrier Frigate is an unusual and extensive modification of the Ashnan Freight Hauler.

Probably the smallest carrier craft conceivable, creating a Baseplate requires a series of extremely ill-advised alterations to the hull of a craft already ill-suited for the rigors of combat.  Nearly all space previously devoted to cargo, fuel and crew amenities has been stripped away to make room for the necessary deck space required to house, arm and launch a wing of fighter craft.  In addition to the logistical drain a Baseplate represents, the extensive stripping of the hull has reduced it's already paltry defensive armaments and, worse, it's shield generator and armor, greatly compromising the crafts survivability.

A Hegemony Engineer, asked about the modified craft, allegedly responded that it was ""almost impressive, if it weren't so damn foolheaded.""",,,
ms_dromedary_drone,SHIP,"A large drone typically used in asteroid mining, the Dromedary is a sturdy support vehicle; armed with a small mining blaster, the Dromedary is not as useful for point defense as the more common Mining Drone but is theoretically more handy in a fight.",,,
ms_vardr,SHIP,"Based off of the failed Jotunn prototype, the Vardr-class Battleship was developed in order to counter a perceived deficiency in heavy combat support; in particular, with the arrival of the Hegemony, the SRA began to feel the lack of a direct answer to the Onslaught.  The Jotunn, and in turn the Vardr, was conceived of as that answer, a powerful battleship which could go blow-for-blow with the Domains aging stalwart and prevail.

Despite the inexplicable calamity surrounding the prototype, much of the Jotunn’s components and basic design were deemed salvageable; however in order to permit the Vardr sufficient speed to remain a viable tactical unit, the Jotunn’s excess of guns and heavy armor were stripped away, and its reliance on questionable experimental devices removed in favor of a far less volatile mobility enhancing system.  While the Vardr’s armaments do not quite match up to the Onslaught as a result, and it is difficult to work into the SRA’s mobile combat doctrine, the vessel is nevertheless considered a formidable heavy combat craft.",,,
ms_minarette,SHIP,"The Minarette class destroyer is a relatively recent addition to the SRA's fleet lineup, centered around a missile focused weapons package with relatively minimal support ability for energy weapons, setting it apart from standard Shadowyards tactical doctrine.

Despite a highly contentious design process, the craft entered service in c. 172 and soon proved itself a valuable support unit for Shadowyards naval forces. Under the right circumstances the ship can prove surprisingly dangerous in a direct confrontation, but these vessels are largely relegated to a back line role where close combat can be avoided.",,,
ms_shikome,SHIP,"Quite possibly representing the upper limit of what is achievable with the SRA’s current technological base in regards to fighter design, the Shikome is a rare and especially deadly small craft. The craft appears to have been developed under strict secrecy, and was at most a rumor until the battle of Gigas Jump in late c. 205, where the Hegemony 6th fleet first encountered the advanced fighter design. 

The Shikome has generally superior handling characteristics, aided by a modified version of the so-called ""Lock drive"" system, and is incredibly heavily armed for its size; standard fighter doctrine does not offer a suitable response, and casualties among squadrons engaging these fighters has thus far been markedly higher than average.

Certain elements of Hegemony Military Intelligence fear that the Shikome fighters encountered thus far represent advanced prototype craft undergoing field trials, and that as soon as the SRA finishes working the kinks out these fearsome craft will enter full production.",Anti-Fighter,,
ms_anu,SHIP,"Anu-class shuttles are a venerable design, which the SRA celebrates as being their first true spacecraft. The early Anu-class served as gunships for the Shadowyards rebellion and fought throughout the Persean Sector, but were rendered obsolete with the introduction of the Enil. Modern variants have had their armament reduced and internal combat systems replaced with passenger quarters.",,,
ms_cetus,SHIP,"The Cetus is a sturdy Bulk Freighter which fulfills a significant portion of the medium scale shipping needs of various parties through much of the sector, making them a familiar sight. While not able to carry quite as much cargo as the venerable Colossus, these ships are close enough in capacity to remain competitive while being better defended and faster.

The class was introduced in early cycle 29, shortly after the Yardie rebels and the Anar Colonial Group formally merged; among the first actions of the new polity was the mass production of these useful logistics craft, anticipating not only future need, but the need to train skilled construction personnel. Additionally, favorable immigration protocols and the offer of steady employment brought a significant uptick in the Anar systems population. Arguably these ships ended up massively overproduced as a result, and it is generally believed that there are still vessels from the original run waiting mothballed.",,,
msp_skolopendra,SHIP,"A variant of the Cetus, the belligerent Skolopendra is thankfully rarely encountered on the Sectors spaceways, as the ship is well armed and extremely dangerous in the right hands. The design is believed to have been the brainchild of a particularly skillful pirate ship-basher who, rather than choose to do the obvious and convert the Cetus into a serviceable carrier, elected to use the vessels ample cargo space to house retrofitted phase coils from captured Afflictors, converting the craft into an improvised phase cruiser.

The bulk of the Skolopendras internal cargo volume has been given over to armored bulkheads, power generators and the engines necessary to manage the vessels extensive armaments package. Numerous adjustments have also been made to the vessels linear drive systems, boosting the ships top speed, though the vessels acceleration remains anemic. This extensive conversion process is time consuming and very costly, and is believed to require a Cetus hull in good condition to act as the basis for its upgunned cousin. Fortunately for the pirates, and unfortunately for everyone else, massive quantities of Cetus frames in reasonably good condition exist and are relatively easy to acquire.",,,
ms_delphi,SHIP,"The Delphi-class is a versatile all-rounder, filling in as a general patrol and combat cruiser in use by the SRA and it's affiliates. While on paper somewhat undergunned, the Delphi makes up for it's slight dearth of firepower with its GAT system.

The class has a solid reputation as a combat cruiser; a lack of significant weaknesses, a reasonably sturdy hull and relatively low cost of production ensure its continued popularity, though it is not generally considered a ""stand out"" warship. The vessels design history has proven of some interest to historians, as the ship appears to have been designed and constructed while the SRA was largely unaware of the projects existence; it is unclear where and when the order requesting a vessel of these specifications was made, and the design appears to have bounced back and forth between a number of different naval design cooperatives for at least 9 cycles before the first run of these vessels was constructed.

Despite the vessels fairly average capabilities, the unintentional secrecy surrounding its production greatly perplexed the Hegemony Intelligence Service, who were caught only slightly less flatfooted than the Yardies themselves.",,,
ms_semele,SHIP,"Suitable for use in the rougher areas of the sector, the Semele is reasonably well defended and has a considerable fuel bunker; they are primarily used to provide logistics support, moving strategic levels of fuel to remote colonies.",,,
ms_lobatus,SHIP,"A tough destroyer designed around a primarily defensive role, the Lobatus is commonly used as an escort for larger warships in particularly heavy engagements.

Though her drive train is serviceable, it is rarely used for much more than getting the ship into position; once in place the vessel digs in, trading mobility for firepower and heavy shielding. Though they do not fit into standard SRA fleet doctrine, ships of this class are nonetheless prized for their ability to lock down vulnerable flanks, allowing more mobile fleet assets greater freedom in the battlespace.",,,
msp_carmine,SHIP,"Named by its Hegemony Navy Reporting Code, the Carmine is a rarely encountered small attack carrier well suited for use as a raider.

Though the vessel is very clearly of Shadowyards design, it is almost exclusively used by Pirates. How the blueprints for this craft came into criminal hands is uncertain, but it is generally believed to be the result of a fumbled attempt to provide the Askonian Revolutionary Council with a combat ship design. Investigation into its source remains inconclusive.

The first reported encounter with vessels of the Carmine-class was in c. 193 when the 'Thresher', commanded by the infamous raider EP Naimal, was destroyed. Of the three Carmines supporting Naimal, the 'Clayton' is believed to have escaped the battle and is still at large.",,,
msp_heckler,SHIP,"A relatively common 'chipbash' fighter, Hecklers consist of a variety of broadly similar Heavy Interceptor designs based primarily upon a Neriad/Skinwalker base featuring an oversized engine housing, giving it very high speed and long range.

These small craft have a reputation as capable dogfighters, and are in use with both pirates and independent captains.",,,
msp_vulgar,SHIP,"Based upon a heavily modified Rakshasha blueprint, the Vulgar-class bomber is sometimes referred to as the 'Blaster Shuttle,' as its payload is generally considered its most notable feature.

ms_eir,SHIP,"As much a political statement as a passenger ship, the Eir class is one of the largest starliners in the history of space travel.

Decried by many, even within the SRA itself, as a pointless display of opulence the class was conceived of as a statement of the superiority of Yardie ideology. The vessel can house thousands of passengers in comfort and style, and is notable for its large recreation and communal spaces, offering a wide variety of onboard services. A relatively small number of these massive ships have been constructed and, despite the efforts of the SRA to keep the cost of access low, demand regularly spikes ticket prices.

It is uncertain how well the SRAs ambitions with these ships has been met; few of the people it was hoped would be served by these craft have been aboard. Ticket scalping and the accompanying price gouging often limits access to the wealthy, a fact not without irony.

ms_kabaloi,SHIP,"Sleek and efficient, the Kabaloi appears to have been commissioned to augment the SRA's fleet of Charybdis' with a less logistically demanding carrier vessel, capable of fielding an equivalent weight of strike craft while placing a significantly lower drain on supplies and fuel.

Though less popular than the Charybdis among Yardie captains and crews, the Kabaloi is nevertheless a capable carrier vessel. The lighter weapons array places significantly lower strain on its power grid, allowing it to field a far more stable shield system despite its lower overall power output. Battlefield maneuvering ability is acceptable for a ship of this class, though it is marginally slower than it's most common equivalent, the Heron.

Generally considered a refinement of the design principles of the Enlil, the class is centered around a battery of synergy hardpoints, giving the craft a high degree of versatility. A powerful drive train, fed by a compact Novalith reactor and augmented by its advanced Quantic Drive, grants the ship very high tactical mobility. Redundant power systems and a large capacitor bank give the ship a highly resilient shield system, which combined with the crafts high mobility results in a frigate that can be remarkably difficult to pin down.

It is expected that the Ninurta will eventually enter broader service, though it is considered very unlikely that this class will replace the Enlil due to it's high cost and demanding logistical profile.",,,

As the device was considered tactically vital in allowing Shadowyards forces to respond to hostile incursions, the Pandora went through several refit programs intended to increase it's detection range.  These programs eventually culminated in the unexpected instantiation of number of devastating p-space rifts during what was to be the Pandora's final testing iteration as a sensor system.

After determining the cause of the disaster, research was begun on weaponizing the Pandora, which necessitated a substantial redesign of the Elysium class Light Cruisers port side pontoon.

Notable for both it's abnormally violent weather patterns and the intense radiation storms it frequently emits, these factors combine to make siphoning volatiles from it's churning atmosphere singularly hazardous, and the infamous 'Calleach Run' is typically only taken by the foolhardy or particularly desperate.",,,
planet_theramin,CUSTOM,"A stormy terrestrial moon, Theramin is protected from intense gamma radiation from the gas giant Calleach due to Domain era radiation absorbers which the SRA has not been able to replicate. As such, despite the otherwise desirable status of the moon, colonization has been limited to a few areas under the protective veil of these massive, arcane devices.  Beyond the monolithic Absorbers, Theramin requires the aid of a pair of large solar arrays redirecting Anarlight to her surface while the world is in Calleach's shadow, and as a result the moon is temperate, if rainy, at nearly all times of the year.",,,
planet_cinderbox,CUSTOM,Cinderbox is in a state of constant volcanic eruption due to her proximity to Calleach.  Immense tidal forces render the planet an uninhabitable hothouse.  This tiny moon is of little mineral worth and has seen no significant effort at exploitation.,,,
planet_melancholia,CUSTOM,"A small moon primarily composed of various cryonic materials, Melancholia has a thin atmosphere of methane and argon.  While a valuable source of cryogenics the planet has seen no serious effort at colonization and most habitats are of a temporary variety, save for a single mostly permanent settlement, Shanty, which is nestled around a supercooled ground-space rail terminus serving the ever shifting amount of small mining concerns on the moon.",,,
planet_rubicante,CUSTOM,"Though permanent habitation is impossible, Rubicante's surface is cool enough, and the planet geologically calm enough, to permit short bursts of mineral extraction from the cooler deposits of metal located all across the surface; extensive mining of the planets vast mineral wealth was the basis of the Gigas systems economy until the mining stations were destroyed in mid Cycle 205, when it became apparent to the Hegemony that they would be unable to seize the facilities.",,,
planet_stillness,CUSTOM,"Stillness was, until recently, a quiet support facility for the mining facilities orbiting Rubicante, having the bulk of the system's ore refining facilities; with those stations destroyed when the Hegemony invaded in c.205, it finds itself playing the unaccustomed role of forward command post.",,,
planet_sturmvald,CUSTOM,"Wrapped in a thick and violent atmosphere, Sturmvald has thwarted a number of halfhearted attempts at exploitation from independent mining concerns across the sector.  Difficult extraction sites, a lethally toxic atmosphere and blistering, silica laden winds combine to make this planet generally considered to be not worth the effort.",,,
station_auris,CUSTOM,"Auris' Grip has only been in orbit for a very short time, having been set up by a surprisingly well equipped pirate coalition only a few months after the Hegemony's arrival.  Since then the number of rogues calling the station home has grown tremendously, and there's little sign that they'll be removed any time soon.",,,
station_lance,CUSTOM,"Too large to be easily evicted, but too small to accomplish its strategic purpose, Lance Base finds itself in the awkward position of being a thorn in the SRA's side.  Set up in a hurry when it became apparent that resistance was too heavy to allow the initial thrust to succeed, this stations facilities are remarkably spartan.",,,
station_prana,CUSTOM,"This colossal space based factory complex is one of the vital centers of the SRA coalition's great industrial might, devoted almost entirely to laying down hulls; tens of thousands of workers make the upper levels of the station their home, while the lower are packed with modular factory units.",,,
berins_stash,CUSTOM,"Established in the mysterious Gliese Field Anomaly on the outer edge of the Anar system, Berin's Stash initially began as a small hideaway for stolen goods for the pirate it draws its name from; over 20 cycles later it has developed into a major freeport frequented by pirates, freebooters, smugglers and other 'free spirits.'",,,
station_udana,CUSTOM,"Built immediately following the Second AI War, Udana Station exists, ostensibly, to provide humanitarian aid to refugees created by the devastation of Hanan Pacha.  Unfortunately it seems as though the effort has left this outpost a victim of its own success, and the station is now inundated with a mass of refugees, swamping the Stations administration and stretching it's logistics to the limit, and the simple design of the station has begun to fade under a mass of habitats, temporary shelters, and other hurriedly jury rigged modules.",,,
outpost_tiger,CUSTOM,"Initially little more than an impromptu firebase constructed to give support to the SRA task forces assigned to the system in the midst of the Askonian Crisis, Outpost Tiger has grown into a sizable military installation, and something of a thorn in the side of the Diktat.  Several attempts have been made to expel the defenders, but so far the installation has managed to resist the Diktat military.",,,
pillager_point,CUSTOM,"Once a research outpost observing the interactions between Yajna and Udgarti, what was once called Dharma Research Post suffered from a massive supply shortage during the collapse and was shortly abandoned for safer havens; for many cycles the station was left empty, until a band of enterprising rogues took up residence some 160 odd cycles ago.  Renamed Pillager Point, it’s grown to haven of various Freebooters and one of the largest and most pernicious Outlaw stations in the region; rumors tell that it’s the headquarters of a particularly violent and well equipped criminal cartel, but this remains unverified.",,,
planet_jnana,CUSTOM,"Once thought to be a worthwhile target for colonization, Jnandas sparse biosphere is dominated by a variety of sporiforms which are highly toxic to humans, and whose ingestion tends to result in vivid, terrifying hallucinations and permanent neurological impairment.  Despite the hazard, the planets material worth is enough to justify its inhabitation, and its position near the main jump entry to the system, in addition to Yajnas strategic location, has resulted in the SRA constructing a major military base here.",,,
planet_hotri,CUSTOM,"Hotri was colonized by one of the initial waves of sporeships, long before any of the other worlds was inhabited.  Comfortably inhabited despite some paucity of water, Hotri is rich in minerals and possesses surprisingly good farmland; both the SRA and Persean League have been making overtures to the local government for some time now, seeking to integrate the valuable world into their respective coalitions, but the locals remain stubbornly independent, unwilling to disrupt their way of life.",,,
hotri_port,CUSTOM,"Converted into an improvised orbital base sometime during the preceding century, Hotri Port is based in the mostly stripped hulk of the sporeship that carried Hotri’s colonists the planet before the collapse.",,,
planet_mantra,CUSTOM,"An unpleasant world requiring significant accommodations to allow human habitation, Mantra joined the Persean League shortly after its founding and has been a reliable source of volatiles and local political turmoil since; the local government only has a very weak military presence, maintaining totalitarian control through an extensive system of secret police, but its population and acceptable industrial capacity has allowed the League to contest control of the system.  Mantra’s frigid atmosphere is host to large quantities of volatiles, and it has small subsurface deposits of organics indicating that at some point in the distant past it played host to some manner of primitive biosphere.",,,
planet_karma,CUSTOM,"A small world of barren rock, Karma is home to a number of valuable ore deposits; the SRA managed to stake first claim and set up a small mining colony on the surface.",,,
maks_hole,CUSTOM,"Reportedly named to mock another pirate lord, Maks Hole is a tiny outpost of lawlessness on the fringe of the system, surviving mostly by obscurity and being too small to bother with; shortages of various types are frequent, and the pirates who make this station their home have a reputation for possessing an almost singular desperation.",,,
wrecked_gate,CUSTOM,"This derelict ring stands scarred, much of its arcane internals absent.",,,

shadow_industry,FACTION,"The Shadowyards Reconstruction Authority is the most lasting incarnation of a long line of anti-Domain movements which survived by virtue of remaining one step ahead of the Domains authority intruding into newly colonized space.  Rejecting the vast machines of the Domains' industry, this lineage of rebel groups had a noted history of modifying, and in some instances designing, machinery and arms to suit their own needs.  In the decades leading up to the collapse this group came under the control of one Alexandr Inokkenti, who put it’s technical expertise to use creating warships and weapons with which to oppose the Domain.

Due to it's unusual capacities and the fact that it managed to survive the Domains wrath, the SRA tends to feature in a supporting role in a number of conspiracy theories; while the supposed intentions and capabilities of the organization vary quite wildly depending on the tale, it is agreed that the SRA are, at best, unsuspecting dupes of some agency with malign intentions for the sector. The entity pulling the Yardies strings is most commonly alleged to be either the Tri-Tachyon corporation or Domain Intelligence, both popular players in a vast number of other conspiracy theories as well.

Having survived both the Domains' reprisals and the Collapse, these rebels formally merged with the civilian government of the Anar system in c. 23 to become the Shadowyards Reconstruction Authority.  The SRA is strongly industrially focused, and the bulk of its efforts and trade is devoted to improving the industrial base and infrustructure of the sector; Hegemony analysts note that the bulk of this material aid goes to entities friendly to the SRA or amenable to becoming a part of the SRA coalition.  SRA officials counter that is difficult to send aid to a power hostile to your presence.",,,
