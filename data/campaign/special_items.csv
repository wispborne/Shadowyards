A minor advantage is that the lower production rate of these devices tends to be less environmentally devestating, and the older technology less likely to incur the wrath of the Luddic Path.

This one has seen better days, and it’s abilities for producing defect-free components has decreased significantly. Nonetheless, having access to an autoforge at all is a step up as far as starship construction goes.",140

This one is in almost perfect condition and likely to produce ship parts that are as high quality as the technology can manage, given the overall state of manufacturing in the Sector.",140.1
