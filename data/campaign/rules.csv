Accepting a commission with the SRA bears with it a number of responsibilities and requirements; you will be expected to fight to further secure our Coalition from its foes and, where possible, to advance the revolution. You may also be expected to smile for cameras and look silly in a dress uniform. It is a matter I advise you think seriously on before accepting.
