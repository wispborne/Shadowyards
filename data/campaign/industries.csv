This particular array of Fabricators has been retooled to focus on the production of massive quantities of industrial goods, and a significant production of supplies. This comes at the cost of quality control, however, and a lower production rate for viable spacecraft and small arms.",160,MEDIUM

This particular array of Fabricators has been retooled to focus on the production of supplies and military grade small arms, vehicles and other such specialist gear. Though the demands of such items requires somewhat more vigorous quality control, this comes at the cost of lower production rates for spacecraft and industrial equipment.",160,MEDIUM

This particular array of Fabricators has been retooled and heavily intergrated with orbital supply lines and specialized facilities to produce high quality spacecraft. The demands of this particular, and particularly important, focus consume much of the supplies and industrial machinery this industry would otherwise produce, and leaves very limited capacity for other military production.",160,HIGH
