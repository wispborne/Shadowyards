Despite some initial difficulties, technological exchange between the Tri-Tachyon Corporation and Persean League has been ongoing for nearly a cycle. Security failures in earlier parts of this selling of Technology and information has resulted in the League significantly bulking up their security details; the last 4 convoys have had to beat back determined Pather raids.

Unfortunately this determination has gradually worn away at the forces assigned to provide protection and now the guard detail for these shipments barely matches the tonnage assigned to the first exchange.

While League intelligence struggles to find the source of the leaks revealing the schedules of the shipments, a large convoy carrying a significant cargo of valuable technological artifacts is en route to Kazeron from Eochu Brais; slipping in through the outer jump node the Captain leading the security detail detects a sizeable group of unidentified contacts burning hard on an intercept course.

Way more sizeable, in fact, than her escort fleet can handle; cursing, she orders her ships to combat stations, and gives the convoy the order to flee.
