In their triumph over the false idol of Mairaath, the most radical elements of the Path were greatly emboldened throughout the two decades which followed. Many of the most ardent flocked to the radical sect responsible for the destruction, and many more formed their own.  These sects turned their eyes to new targets, seeking to use their percieved advantage and clear divine favor to crush other apostates throughout the sector.

After a series of failed attacks against Tri-Tachyon, however, the faithful finally admit that they must turn their eyes to less formidable agents of Technological Evil; the SRA, while far less abhorent, preaches a message of faith in technology and attempts to spread their knowledge and ideology.  They have proven worryingly successful, several neighboring systems accepting their gift of Mammon, though none as yet have formally joined them.

Unwilling to allow these heretics to succeed, several Pather sects pool their resources, despite their doctrinal differences, and their leaders decide upon a plan of attack.

You, commanding a small group of the most faithful, have been selected to carry out this holy task, cleansing Euripides of its apostate disease.  You have quietly evaded the patrols thus far, but as you close in on Euripides Gate a Shadowyards patrol group enters hyperspace, blocking your path unexpectedly.

In the final hours before their attack at Mairaath, the martyrs of your Sect covertly acquired a terrible weapon and slipped it out in the confusion.  A virus bomb, a sign of technologies true repugnance.  But also an ironic sword to wield against the adherents of those false idols; it has been commanded that you destroy the enemy with their own craven works.

This sword will fall upon Euripides, even should you die in the act.
