It is the midst of the Askonia Crisis; some weeks before the capital moon of the system, Opis, had been destroyed in a planet cracking attack in the midst of the confusion. An SRA relief force, dispatched some months earlier in an effort to bring the situation under control, and shaken by event works desperately to maintain the peace.

Complicating matters is the presence of the Hegemony battlegroup under the command of Admiral Phillip Andrada; while both forces have so far avoided more than minor skirmishing, the mutual posturing of both fleets largely prevents effectively dealing with the swarms of revolutionaries attempting to claim the system. In an effort to provide better logistical support and thus gain the edge, the Coordinators office orders the construction of a temporary Firebase to act as a berth and repair yard for the SRA in the region.

Vice Executor Dhera Singh is assigned the task of providing security while the Yardie constructors assemble the prefabricated frame of Firebase Tiger. Thus far the assignment has been quiet.

It is not to last; during routine scans, an unidentified contact registers on the board, far closer than expected.  Deep scans reveal a sizeable fleet of Revolutionaries under silent running moving on an intercept course.  Realizing the setback that would occur were this raid successful, Singh orders her fleet on an intercept course.
