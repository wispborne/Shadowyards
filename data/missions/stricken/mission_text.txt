Location: Gigas, far Kain orbit
Date: 205.08.27

Their inital assault unexpectedly repulsed, the Hegemony find their position in the Gigas system far less tentable than their tactical projections anticipated. By bypassing the heavier defenses in Jnana it was believed that a serious blow could be struck against its underdefended neighbor; unexpectedly stiff resistance has put this mission in jeapordy, and forced the unfortunate destruction of the SRA held mining platform over Rubicante in order to prevent it from remaining in enemy hands.

In the immediate aftermath, the Hegmony commander orders his remaining forces to rendezvous and regroup near the icy outer rim planet Kain as he and his staff go over their options. In the meantime, engineering teams accompanying the Hegemony force begin assembling a set of prefab facilities to provide a forward staging base; the Hegemony Expeditionary Force settles in for a longer campaign.

Lieutenant A.J. Morton is a junior officer assigned to one of the patrol groups meant to protect the construction site; Morton is an unexceptional officer, but he is extremely ambitious.  When the scopes light up with an SRA Strike team burning hard past the outer patrols, Morton ignores his orders to wait for backup.

After all, lady luck just gave him his chance to shine.
