The Thresher.

Your pride, your joy.

First, and to this point, only ship of her class.  Your brainchild, created from the dross of those arrogant Yardies.

With her in your arsenal you've left a trail of looted ships in your wake, growing ever more notorious.  And now you face down a fleet of bounty hunters, fools thinking they can make their name from your demise.

But today they face the Thresher.

Your pride, your joy.
