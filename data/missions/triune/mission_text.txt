Captains, at ease.

As you may have heard, 3 days ago at approximately 0230 hours a Hegemony Special Forces team slipped past our lines and launched a covert attack on one of our research facilities on Jnana. While reports remain sketchy, damage appears to be pretty heavy and most involve significant loss of life. Much of the research team appears to have been killed, and they may have been the target of the attack.

It's still uncertain what they were after, but intelligence suggests that Hegemony forces may have have absconded with valuable research data and if so are likely carrying it aboard a Mule-class frieghter, the HSS Idolotor.  We're on damage control.

Currently the Idolotor is being tracked by a handful of scouts who are keeping us up to date on the ships location; they report the transport is currently en route to the outer system Jump Node with a small escort. Given the size of the force, we expect that they were hoping to give our sensor nets the slip and escape into Hyperspace undetected.

The Convoy is projected to be be passing through the systems fringe jump node near the edge of the SRA's zone of control.  This represents our last chance to prevent any stolen research from falling into enemy hands.  Disable the Idolotor and then fly cover 'til we can get a recovery team on site.  Unfortunately, due to the relative isolation of the area, our forces are pretty thin; you'll have to make due with what we've been able to vector for the intercept. 

We don't know how much is riding on this mission, but we have to assume the worst.  Make it count out there.
